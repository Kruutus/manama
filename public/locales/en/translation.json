    "title": "INTRODUCTION",
    "description-1": "Our agency’s mission is to assume the role of an authoritative intermediary – in facilitating the cultivation of mutually beneficial business collaborations – between Bahrain, the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) Nations and Hungary. <br /><br /> As a result of my residency and occupational engagement in Bahrain since 2016, I have acquired an extensive and nuanced understanding of the country and the region at multiple levels, while simultaneously building a network of reliable players in the economic sphere, ranging from small to large corporations of diverse economic domains. <br /> <br /> Drawing on my extensive familiarity with the customs, legal regulations, and the latest market trends of both Hungary and the Gulf region, as well as trusted and well-established business connections <br /> <br />– I am eager to devote my competency and expertise in the local landscape to enhance Your business prospects within the regional market.",
    "description-2": "Our commitment to achieving this objective involves facilitating Your presence in the market, forging valuable connections through networking, and linking Your organization/enterprise with appropriate and promising collaborative ventures. <br /> <br /> I commenced my journey of building a regional network during the nascent stage of my career in 2004, when I relocated to London soon after Hungary’s accession to the European Union. As the head of my initial venture in the fitness industry, I engaged with professionals from diverse domains worldwide, establishing a broad range of connections from the outset. <br /> <br /> Within a few years, I transitioned into the realm of property development and have since operated as a thriving entrepreneur in the lucrative buy-to-let sector. Following the Brexit referendum in 2016, I felt compelled to explore fresh horizons, and acting on my intuition, I relocated to Bahrain. Recognizing the significant potential of the market, I founded the Bahrain-Hungary Relations export promotion agency with fervor and a profound sense of purpose. <br /> <br /> Currently, we maintain active collaborations with over a hundred companies, and we firmly believe that the opportunities lie open to us to effectively showcase the premium quality of Hungarian expertise, as well as the cutting-edge innovations and technologies that our nation has to offer to the world. <br /> <br /> With warm regards, I am looking forward to the prospect of welcoming You as our esteemed collaborative partner in the near future! <br /> <br /> Tamás Hovány <br /> Chairman & CEO <br /> Bahrain & Hungary-Relations"
